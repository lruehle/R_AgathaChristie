# R_AgathaChristie

Making Babysteps in R

CSV Data taken from https://github.com/JamesJackson1/AgathaChristie. Added columns with Publication Date & Detective. 

Goal of this project is to create some fun tables & graphs comparing murderers, weapons, occupations etc. throughout the available Agatha Christie books. 
Maybe a pattern can be found? Maybe Agatha Christie loved making butlers into murderers? Maybe her books became more bloody over the years?
Maybe every third book contains a female murderer that strangels at least 5 people, but only if Hercule Poirot investigates? 
Answers to these highly important questions can soon be found in this R script. Enjoy!



Created for the Course "Datenanalyse mit R" - Sommersemester 2022, taught by Dr. JÃ¼rgen Hermes at the University of Cologne
